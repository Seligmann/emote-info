# EmoteInfo
EmoteInfo provides user-level emote statistics based on traffic to https://www.destiny.gg/. Development for the chat at https://www.twitch.tv/xqc is currently in development.

# Usage
Simply search a valid username (e.g. `ze1ig`, `cake`) for a user from https://www.destiny.gg/ into the search bar.

# Functionality
This site works because of https://overrustlelogs.net/ (ORL). Because of ORL and it's API, messages from each day since 2013 are available, and the info regarding emote usage is able to be gathered.

# Contributing
This project isn't currently setup for public contribution, but perhaps I will structure it for that in the future. It is currently open source because I want others to be able to see it easily, and I think it's also fun to show in this fashion.
