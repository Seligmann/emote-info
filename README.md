# dgg-emote-profiles
Dgg Emote Profiles provide user-level emote statistics based on traffic to https://www.destiny.gg/. This site will support https://www.twitch.tv/xqc in the future, and possibly more channels.

# Usage
Simply search a valid username for a user from https://www.destiny.gg/ into the search bar.

# Functionality
This site works because of https://overrustlelogs.net/ (ORL). Because of ORL and it's API, messages from each day since 2013 are available, and the info regarding emote usage is able to be gathered.

# Contributing
Currently, the project isn't setup for public contributers, but perhaps I will structure it for that in the future. It is currently open source mainly because it serves a niche community, and having code stolen would not only be comical (because this is my first web dev project), but also wouldn't do anything else besides disappoint me.
